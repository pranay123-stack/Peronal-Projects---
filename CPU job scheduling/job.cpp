/* Job Scheduling
 *
 * DOCUMENTATION
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * 1. Priority of no 2 jobs will ever be equal (given).
 *
 * Data Structures Used:
 * + The system has the following data structures:
 *   -- A map of unique_id to each job.
 *      -> Efficient lookup by unique_id (assigned by us).
 *      -> An binary tree was used instead of a hash-map to avoid
 *         performance degradation due to the nature of memory (paging, cache locality).
 *   -- A Bi-directional map to store instructions and originating string and an
 *      identifier integer, for efficient access from both key and value.
 *      -> A hash-map is used instead of a binary tree map to avoid overheads
 *         and because the size of the tree is given to not be too large.
 *   -- A priority queue of jobs currently waiting in the queue.
 *      -> Build-in abstract priority_queue is a heap, sorted in the
 *         order of increasing priority.
 *      -> Best data structure for a priority queue, O(1) lookup,
 *         O(lg n) insertion & deletion.
 *   -- A priority queue of timestamps of busy CPUs (the timestamp of when they
 *      are supposed to be finished processing), another min-heap.
 *   -- A vector of (time_of_arrival, unique_id) corresponding to each job.
 *      -> Insertion is performed when a new job is added.
 *      -> The vector is sorted by timestamp, search can be done in O(log n).
 *   -- A vector of (timestamp, state_of_queue), which stores the state of queue
 *      corresponding to the timestamp at each "assign" operation.
 *      -> The state is stored only if the time difference between the new assign statement
 *         and the last assign is greater than a fixed interval of time.
 *      -> Since the insertion is done in an ordered manner according to timestamp,
 *         lookup can be done in O(log n).
 *   -- A vector of (timestamp, num_free_CPUs).
 *      -> It stores the number of free CPUs available at the time of each assign statement call.
 *   -- Vectors are used here because the order of timestamp of "assign" and "job" commands is
 *      guranteed to be non-deceasing, therefore insertion can be done is O(1) and lookup in O(log n)
 *      which is very-efficient due to having almost no overhead due to container use.
 *  *** The (timestamp, unique_id) and (timestamp, num_free_cpus) is merged
 *  into one vector for convenience of processing queries.***
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * + "job" command:    the job is inserted into the map, the job vector and the job queue.
 * + "assign" command: the free CPUs are collected, min(k, f, s) jobs are popped from
 *                      the job queue and assigned. The state of the job queue at this
 *                      timestamp is stored if the difference of timestamp exceeds a
 *                      given limit. Otherwise, only the number of free CPUs is stored.
 * + "query" command:  for a given timestamp, the job queue history vector is searched for the
 *                      timestamp just lesser than the one required, then the state
 *                      is evaluated and the required jobs is calculated based on how
 *                      many jobs lie in the obtained time interval.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 *      No. of jobs = j
 *      No. of assign commands = k
 *      No. of CPUs = n
 *
 *      Space Complexity = O(n + kj)
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 *      No. of jobs = j
 *      No. of assign commands = k
 *      No. of CPUs = n
 *
 *  + "job" : O(log j)
 *  + "assign" : O(n + jlog j)
 *  + "query <k>" : O(log k + jlog j)
 *  + "query <orig>" : O(log k + jlog j)
